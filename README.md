## Hi there 👋

### 🚀 A little about me...

I am Elise Acher, a **Full Stack Developer** (specialising mostly in frontend but with a curioisty for backend too) with a real passion for bringing ideas to life in the most creative of ways. My academic background is in Physics, where I was first introduced to Data Science and python for data collection, manipulation and presentation. There I completed my Bachelors Degree at the University of Manchester, Uk.


🛠️ In May of 2024 I graduated from the Le Wagon London Full Stack Development bootcamp which faciliated as a way to brush up on my previous development skills as well as deepen my understanding of the development process from concept to completion. From this, I have embarked on my freelance journey as well as experiementing with building SAAS's.
